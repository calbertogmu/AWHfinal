      <h2>American Women and The Holocaust</h2>
      <p>This project came about through somewhat accidental means. When researching oral histories of Holocaust survivors, I stumbled across the oral history interview of Pat Lynch. When I listened to her interview, I realized how important the accounts of liberators are. I began digging and found less than twenty interviews of U.S. Army nurses that cared for the survivors of NAZI concentration camps. </p>
      <p>It is not the place of the website author at this time to analyze these oral histories. The information created by the website author is limited to the summaries under select oral histories. In an effort to accomodate the members of the deaf and hard of hearing communities, the website author has used AdobePremierPro to add captions to the video recorded oral histories. Some have been checked for typos, but there are some that have only the captions automatically created by the program. </p>
      <p>The website uses a template created by <a href="https://www.tooplate.com/view/2116-blugoon">TooPlate</a>, and was edited using AdobeDreamweaver.</p>
      <p>All digital material located within the website was procured from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and are listed in no particular order.</p>
      <p>This website, and its author are NOT affilliated with the United States Holocaust Memorial Musuem; this website is for educational purposes only.</p>

            <p>Oral History Interview of Pat Lynch. In this interview, lynch describes her experience working as a nurse at a field hospital in Germany after the liberation of a concentration camp. It has been subtititled by the website creator for the Deaf/HOH community. </p>
